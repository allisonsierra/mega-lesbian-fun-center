# Game Concept

## Summary

You are a lesbian with enough capital to start your dream business, and you have decided to start your journey towards building the best **Mega Lesbian Fun Center** in the world for your fellow lesbians. You must not only build a sustainable business by managing income and cost, but your actions have an impact on the community and positive impacts will help you grow the business the fastest.

## Goals

- While playing on lesbian culture and stereotypes, this game should be positive and not harmful.
- Be as anti-capitalist as possible and make failing to improve your community a fail condition for the game

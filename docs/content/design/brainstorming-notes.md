# Brainstorming Notes

- Classic lesbian business dreams:
  - Coffee shop
  - Bed and Breakfast
  - Bookstore

- Features of the ultimate Mega Lesbian Fun Center:
  - Cafe / Coffee Shop and book store
    - Tea, Coffee, Smoothies
    - Baked goods like scones
    - Tabletop gaming
    - Lots of dietary options (Except keto)
  - Bar / lounge
     - Only shows women sports on the TV (RE: Portland)
  - Vegan Bakery
    - Supplies the coffee shop
  - Climbing wall
  - Roller derby rink
  - Indoor bicycle racing track
    - Adjacent pro shop / maintenance center
  - Atrium / sun room / greenhouse with plants
  - Animal therapy
    - Dogs and cats are always around
    - Great for people that cannot have their own pets
  - Clothing shop
    - Stock the shop with popular items for various lesbian fashion styles
  - Barber chair / hair stylist
    - Able to offer all the best lesbian hair styles
  - Seasonal Activity / Flexible Space
    - Space to handle trends that come in go
    - Axe throwing area for butch lesbians to demonstrate feats of strength
    - Runway for femme lesbian fashion shows
  - Arts and Craft Studio
    - Needlework including knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, etc
    - Painting, photography, pottery and other mediums
  - Design / Decoration
    - Should be able to decorate areas according to various lesbian styles such as Victorian goth, super bright and bubbly, outdoor adventure, plaid/flannel, etc.
    - Choice of design could impact how certain lesbian types react to an area, whether they are attracted to it or avoid it

- Economy
  - Any approach we can take to make this game less capitalistic the better
  - Maybe the center is co-op owned, or that's the goal to get out from the starting loan
  - Not only is money a resource to worry about, community health impact and public relations have to be managed as well. The more the business provides back to the community, the better it will do regardless of profit or balance sheet

- Future expansions
  - Start with the Fun Center but once that's large enough, could extend into then building out the best lesbian compound or intentional living community. This would offer different management mechanics but also assumes at this stage of the game the Fun Center has become community owned and self-suficient so our protagonist can move on to a new challenge
